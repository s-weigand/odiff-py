NAME
       odiff - Find difference between 2 images.

SYNOPSIS
       odiff [OPTION]â€¦ [BASE] [COMPARING] [DIFF]

DESCRIPTION
       odiff is the fastest pixel-by-pixel image comparison tool.

       Supported image types: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tiff

ARGUMENTS
       BASE
           Path to base image

       COMPARING
           Path to comparing image

       DIFF
           Diff output path (.png only)

OPTIONS
       --antialiasing, --aa
           With this flag enabled, antialiased pixels are not counted to the
           diff of an image

       --diff-color=VAL
           Color used to highlight different pixels in the output (in hex
           format e.g. #cd2cc9).

       --dm, --diff-mask
           Output only changed pixel over transparent background.

       --fail-on-layout
           Do not compare images and produce output if images layout is
           different.

       -i VAL, --ignore=VAL
           An array of regions to ignore in the diff. One region looks like
           "x1:y1-x2:y2". Multiple regions are separated with a ','.

       --output-diff-lines
           With this flag enabled, output result in case of different images
           will output lines for all the different pixels

       --parsable-stdout
           Stdout parsable output

       --reduce-ram-usage
           With this flag enabled odiff will use less memory, but will be
           slower in some cases.

       -t THRESHOLD, --threshold=THRESHOLD (absent=0.1)
           Color difference threshold (from 0 to 1). Less more precise.

COMMON OPTIONS
       --help[=FMT] (default=auto)
           Show this help in format FMT. The value FMT must be one of auto,
           pager, groff or plain. With auto, the format is pager or plain
           whenever the TERM env var is dumb or undefined.

       --version
           Show version information.

EXIT STATUS
       odiff exits with:

       0   on image match

       21  on layout diff when --fail-on-layout

       22  on image pixel difference
